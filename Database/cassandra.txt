==> Cassandra gives you an tunable consistency at a query level as well.

==> mermer3 and md5 are used as hashing algos used in Cassandra

==> node - where you store the actual data
    cluster - collection of nodes(can be only one node as well), these can span across multiple datacenters.

==> you can set replication strategy at minute level. 
    - simplestrattegy with factor 3 => copy data to three other nodes
    - networkToplogy mode -> you can mention factor for each individual datacenters(eg dc1:1 and dc2:2) total replication would become 3

==> hinted hadnoff, in case of failures the coordinator node will keep the hints/failures info and will contact the node once it is recovered    



==> keyspace outer most container that contains the data(similar to Database in mysql)
    - COLUMN FAMILIES - similar to tables in a Database

==> all the incoming data is first written to a commit log before it is written to a memtable.
