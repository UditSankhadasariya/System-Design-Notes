==> before, jumping directly into the high-level design, always do the back of the envelope calculations first

==> do not spend a lot of time just quickly go through the numbers and jump to the design

==>keep the assumption values simple as possible.

cheat sheet
- everything is in multiple of 3's
NO. OF ZEROES	TRAFFIC 	STORAGE
3	            THOUSANDS	KB
6	            MILLION	    MB
9	            BILLION	    GB
12	            TRILLION	TB
15	            quadrillion	PB



- for data types
char -> ascii - 1 byte
        unicode - 2 bytes
int/long -> 8 bytes
image avg size -> 300 Kb

==> for finding per second count from daily count we will divide by (24*60*60) -> 86400 we can approximate this to 1 lakh -> 10^5

==> 1month has 2.5 million seconds

==> 1B rqe per month is 400 req per second

==> PERCENTILES :-  if we have 1 million requests as test data, than min.max,avg wont give us the perfect picture of whats happening,
 thats were percentile comes in.
        - avg is not a good metric bcz some outliers(extreme large values) can ruin your avg.
        - if we say 95th percentile is 30ms means 95% of requests are below 30ms.
        - to calculoate that, just sort it and the check the index wrt to percentage(eg for 10 items 75th percenetile would be at index 7.5 ~ 8 so whatever is at 8th index we would conclude that all 75% values are lesser than 75th percetile)
